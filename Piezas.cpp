/** CLASS Piezas
 * Class for representing a Piezas vertical board, which is roughly based
 * on the game "Connect Four" where pieces are placed in a column and 
 * fall to the bottom of the column, or on top of other pieces already in
 * that column. For an illustration of the board, see:
 *  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four
 *
 * Board coordinates [row,col] should match with:
 * [2,0][2,1][2,2][2,3]
 * [1,0][1,1][1,2][1,3]
 * [0,0][0,1][0,2][0,3]
 * So that a piece dropped in column 2 should take [0,2] and the next one
 * dropped in column 2 should take [1,2].

 * the most adjacent pieces in a single line. Lines can go either vertically
